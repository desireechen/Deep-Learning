# Deep-Learning with TensorFlow

This is a collection of my own notes as I am learning more about Deep Learning. 

There is a mini-project using Keras on the Diabetes dataset. 

The other 3 notebooks using TensorFlow are created using Google Colab (I like their easy access to GPUs). 
There is 1 notebook each for Image Classification, Natural Language Processing and Time Series.
